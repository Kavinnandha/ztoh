        description: "The SAT is a standardized test widely used for college admissions in the United States. It has undergone name and scoring changes since its introduction in 1926. The test aims to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills relevant to academic success in college. It consists of two main sections: Evidence-Based Reading and Writing (EBRW) and Math, further divided into subsections. Previously, there was an optional essay section, but it has been discontinued in most cases.",
        details: "The total duration of the scored portion is three hours. Scores range from 400 to 1600, with each section scored on a scale of 200 to 800. The SAT includes multiple-choice questions, with some math questions requiring grid-in responses. Points are awarded for correct answers. The test is designed to assess skills learned in school that are essential for college-level problem-solving and analysis."

Paper 1 is for admission to undergraduate engineering programs, while Paper 2 is for admission to B. Arch and B. Planning courses. The JEE (Main) will be conducted in two sessions, providing candidates with two opportunities to improve their scores and learn from their mistakes. The NTA aims to reduce the chances of students dropping a year by offering multiple exam sessions. If a candidate misses one session due to uncontrollable reasons, they do not have to wait for a whole year. Candidates can choose to appear in one or both sessions, and the best scores will be considered for the merit list/ranking. To accommodate variations in syllabus reduction by different boards, the NTA provides choices in one section of each subject while maintaining the same number of questions to be attempted. Overall, the NTA strives to ensure fair and efficient assessments that benefit students and contribute to the improvement of education quality and equity."
